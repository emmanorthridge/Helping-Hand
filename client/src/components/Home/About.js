        Helping hand is the Online Volunteering Community. Inspired by the
        events of 2020, our aim is to connect those who have a little extra time
        with those who need it. In this community, users can share their posts
        for assistance, whether it’s dog walking, gardening, picking up
        groceries or precriptions- all socially distanced of course! Just state
        what kind of help you need (don’t forget to mention if it’s recurring
        i.e. dog walking), and on what days, and then hit ‘Post’. Remember to
        keep your personal details off the post, and don’t share them until
        you’ve connected with a volunteer. Those people with extra time can
        choose to connect with those needing some help by commenting on the
        posts.
